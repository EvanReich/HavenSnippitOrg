Create a Verilog module that implements a 4-to-2 priority encoder using logical operators.
The module should have four inputs: ABCD (4-bit input bus) and two outputs: YZ (2-bit output bus).
Use continuous assignment (assign) statements with logical OR operations to generate the outputs based on the input values.
Each output bit of YZ should be determined directly from combinations of the input bits without using always blocks or conditional operators.

module LOGENC (
  input  [3:0] ABCD,
  output [1:0] YZ
);

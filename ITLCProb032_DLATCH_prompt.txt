Create a Verilog module named DLATCH that models a level-sensitive D latch.
The module should have inputs C (control signal) and D (data input), and outputs Q and Qn.
When C is high (1), Q should take the value of D, and Qn should take the inverse of D.
When C is low (0), the latch should hold its previous output values.
Use nonblocking assignments for output updates within an always block sensitive to both C and D.

module DLATCH (
    output reg Q, Qn,
    input wire C, D
);

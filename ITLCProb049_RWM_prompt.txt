Create a 4-word, 4-bit read/write memory module named RWM.
The module shall have a 4-bit output data_out, a 2-bit input address, a 1-bit input WE (write enable), and a 4-bit input data_in.
Declare a 4-word, 4-bit reg array RW[0:3]. Implement an always block sensitive to address, WE, and data_in.
Within this block, if WE is high, the memory location RW[address] shall hold data_in.
Otherwise, data_out shall hold the value stored in RW[address].

module RWM (
    output reg [3:0] data_out,
    input wire [1:0] address,
    input wire WE,
    input wire [3:0] data_in
);

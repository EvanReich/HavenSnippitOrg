Create a Verilog module with one input: A, and one output: F.
The output F should represent the logical inversion of input A (i.e., F = NOT A).
Include a propagation delay of 3 nanoseconds in the assign statement to simulate gate delay.
This delay causes the output to ignore small, brief pulses on the input signal that last less than 3 nanoseconds, effectively filtering out glitches.

module INVDELAY (
  input A,
  output F
);

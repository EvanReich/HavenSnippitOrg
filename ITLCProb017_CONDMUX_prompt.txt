Create a Verilog module that implements a 4-to-1 multiplexer using conditional operators.
The module should have four data inputs: A, B, C, and D, a 2-bit select input Sel, and one output F.
Implement the multiplexing logic using a single continuous assignment (assign) statement with nested conditional operators to select the output based on the select lines.
Include a default case that assigns unknown (X) to F for any unspecified input combinations.

module CONDMUX (
  input  A, B, C, D,
  input  [1:0] Sel,
  output F
);

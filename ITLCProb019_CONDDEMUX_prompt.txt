Create a Verilog module that implements a 1-to-4 demultiplexer using conditional operators.
The module should have one data input A, a 2-bit select input Sel, and four outputs: W, X, Y, and Z.
Implement the demultiplexing logic using continuous assignment (assign) statements with conditional operators to route the input A to one of the four outputs based on the binary value of Sel.
Each output should receive A only when its corresponding select combination is active; otherwise, it should output 0.

module CONDDEMUX (
  input  A,
  input  [1:0] Sel,
  output W, X, Y, Z

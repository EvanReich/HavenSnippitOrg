Create a 4-word, 4-bit synchronous read-only memory module named SIMPLESYNCROM.
The module shall have a 4-bit output data_out, a 2-bit input address, and a clock input Clock. 
mplement an always block triggered on the positive edge of Clock that uses a case statement on address to assign data_out with blocking assignments.
The assignments shall be: address 0 holds 4'b1110, address 1 holds 4'b0010, address 2 holds 4'b1111, address 3 holds 4'b1010, and the default case holds 4'bXXXX.

module SIMPLESYNCROM (
    output reg [3:0] data_out,
    input wire [1:0] address,
    input wire Clock
);

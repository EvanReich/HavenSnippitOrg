Model a circuit using blocking assignments that demonstrates sequential execution within an always block.
The output Y should be the logical AND of inputs A and B, while the output Z should be the logical OR of inputs B and C.
The always block should be sensitive to any changes in A, B, or C.

module BLOCKANDOR (
    output reg Y, Z,
    input wire A, B, C
);

Create a circuit that uses non-blocking assignments to illustrate how multiple outputs can be updated simultaneously within an always block. 
The output Y should represent the logical AND of inputs A and B, and the output Z should represent the logical OR of inputs B and C. 
The always block should trigger whenever A, B, or C changes.

module NONBLOCKANDOR (
    output reg Y, Z,
    input wire A, B, C
);

Create a Verilog module that implements a 4-to-1 multiplexer using logical operators.
The module should have four data inputs: A, B, C, and D, a 2-bit select input Sel, and one output F.
Use continuous assignment (assign) statements with AND, OR, and NOT operators to select the appropriate input based on the select lines.
The output F should reflect the value of the selected input according to the binary value of Sel.

module LOGMUX (
  input  A, B, C, D,
  input  [1:0] Sel,
  output F
);

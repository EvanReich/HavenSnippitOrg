Design a circuit that demonstrates interdependent blocking assignments within an always block.
Use an internal register n1 to store the intermediate result of the XOR operation between inputs A and B.
Then, compute the final output S as the XOR of n1 and input C.
The always block should update whenever A, B, or C changes.

module INTERDEPENDENT (
    output reg S,
    input wire A, B, C
);

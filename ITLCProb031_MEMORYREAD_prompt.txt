Create a testbench module that reads binary data from a file into a predeclared storage array. 
The module should have a predeclared input FILENAME specifying the file to read. 
The module should have an output storage array memory[7:0] of 3-bit vectors. Use $readmemb to load the data from FILENAME into memory. 
Include two separate initial blocks. The first block, named Read_Block, should read the file into memory. 
The second block, named Print_Block, should print each element of memory to the simulation transcript. 
Each printed line should follow the format: "reading memory (n-1th digit of 8-bit memory)"

module MEMORYREAD (
    input  [8*20:1] FILENAME,
    output reg [2:0] memory [7:0]
);

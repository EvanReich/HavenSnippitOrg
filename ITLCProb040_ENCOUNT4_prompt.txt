Create a synthesizable 4-bit enabled up-counter module named ENCOUNT4.
The module shall have the following ports: Clock (input), Reset (input, active-low asynchronous reset), EN (input, active-high count enable), and CNT (output reg [3:0]) representing the counter value.
The counter logic shall be implemented in a single sequential block named COUNTER, sensitive to the positive edge of Clock and the negative edge of Reset.
Inside COUNTER, when Reset is asserted low, CNT shall be reset to 4'b0000 using a nonblocking assignment.
When Reset is high and EN is asserted (EN == 1), CNT shall increment by one using a nonblocking assignment.
If EN is deasserted, CNT shall hold its current value.
Use nonblocking assignments throughout and name the sequential block exactly COUNTER.

module ENCOUNT4 (
    output reg [3:0] CNT,
    input wire Clock, Reset, EN
);

Create a 4-word, 4-bit read-only memory module named COMPLEXROM using an internal array.
The module shall have a 4-bit output data_out and a 2-bit input address.
Declare a 4x4-bit internal reg array named ROM[0:3] and initialize it in an initial block with the following values: ROM[0] = 4'b1110, ROM[1] = 4'b0010, ROM[2] = 4'b1111, ROM[3] = 4'b0100.
Implement a combinational always block sensitive to address that assigns data_out from ROM[address] using a blocking assignment.

module COMPLEXROM (
    output reg [3:0] data_out,
    input wire [1:0] address
);

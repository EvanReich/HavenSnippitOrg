Create a testbench module that generates a clock signal as long as an enable signal EN is high. 
The clock CLK should start at 0 and toggle every 10 time units while EN == 1. 
When EN becomes 0, the clock stops toggling and holds its last value.

module ENCLOCK (
    output reg CLK,
    input wire EN
);

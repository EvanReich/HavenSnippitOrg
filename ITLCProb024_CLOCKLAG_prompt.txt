Create a circuit that demonstrates non-blocking assignments to introduce a one-clock-cycle delay. 
The input A is first assigned to an internal register B, and then B is assigned to the output F on the rising edge of the clock. 
This ensures that F updates one cycle after A.

module CLOCKLAG (
    output reg F,
    input wire A,
    input wire Clock
);

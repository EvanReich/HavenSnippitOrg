Create a module named DFLIPFLOP that models an edge-triggered D flip-flop.
The module should have inputs Clock and D, and outputs Q and Qn.
The flip-flop should update its outputs on the positive edge of the clock signal.
At each rising edge, Q should take the value of D, and Qn should take the inverse of D.
Use nonblocking assignments inside the always @ (posedge Clock) block to ensure proper sequential behavior.

module DFLIPFLOP ( 
    output reg Q, Qn,
    input wire Clock, D
);

Create a Verilog module that implements a 1-to-4 demultiplexer using logical operators.
The module should have one data input A, a 2-bit select input Sel, and four outputs: W, X, Y, and Z.
Use continuous assignment (assign) statements with AND and NOT operators to route the input signal A to exactly one of the outputs based on the binary value of Sel.
Each output should be active (logic high) only when its corresponding select combination is chosen.

module LOGDEMUX (
  input  A,
  input  [1:0] Sel,
  output W, X, Y, Z
);

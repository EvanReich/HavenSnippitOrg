Create a testbench module that writes input values to a file, using $fopen, $fdisplay, and $fclose.
The module should create a file called "Data_out.txt" open it to FILE_1, and write the values of inputs A (integer) and B (real) to it.
The written format should be "A is (integer value)" and "B is (real value)"

module FILEWRITE (
    input integer A,
    input real B
);

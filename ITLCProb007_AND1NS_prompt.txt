Create a Verilog module with two inputs: A and B, and one output: F.
The output F should represent the logical AND of the two inputs.
Include a propagation delay of 1 nanosecond in the assign statement to simulate the time it takes for the output to respond to input changes.

module AND1NS (
  input A,
  input B,
  output F
);
